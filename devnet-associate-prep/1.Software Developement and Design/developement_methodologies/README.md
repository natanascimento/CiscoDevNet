# Development Methodologies

# Agile

Is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. 

In the **Agile** model, both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model.

Lean is a way of optimizing the people, resources, effort, and energy of your organization toward creating value for the customer. 

It is based on two guiding tenets, continuous improvement and respect for people.

# Waterfall 

Waterfall model is a linear project management approach, where stakeholder and customer requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project, and then a sequential project plan is created to accommodate those requirements.

# Comparing models

For Agile software development, specifically Scrum and eXtreme Programming are the best to be used due to their versatility at the time of development, where we do not directly depend on another specific step and if we need to make any changes, we would not be returning to the beginning as well as the Waterfall model.
